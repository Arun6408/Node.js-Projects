## Backend Projects

I have developed several backend projects showcasing my expertise in building robust and secure APIs. My work includes advanced features like JWT authentication, complex filtering, and personalized data management. Each project highlights different aspects of backend development, from task management to secure user authentication.

### Task Manager
A comprehensive task management API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks efficiently. Built with robust error handling and validation to ensure data integrity.

### Store API
An advanced store API featuring sophisticated filtering and searching capabilities. This project demonstrates how to implement complex query parameters to refine search results, making it highly useful for e-commerce and inventory management systems.

### Login Portal
A secure login portal incorporating JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. This project emphasizes user authentication and authorization, ensuring that sensitive data is protected and only accessible to authenticated users.

### Jobs API
An API designed to manage job postings and applications with JWT authentication. Each user can maintain their own set of jobs, providing a personalized and secure experience. This project showcases the ability to handle user-specific data while maintaining high security standards.

### Setup
For each project, please refer to the respective README files for detailed setup instructions. These files provide step-by-step guidance to help you get the projects up and running smoothly.
